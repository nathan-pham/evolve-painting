# Evolve a Painting
Leverage genetic algorithms to evolve a population of polygons into a recognizable painting  
View it [live](https://evolve-painting.vercel.app/)

## Concept
1. initialize a bunch of polygons
2. mutate a polygon (vertice, color)
3. is the new painting of polygons closer to the source image? If it is, overwrite the best painting with current polygon "DNA"
4. repeat from 2

## Screenshots

Like what you see? Consider contributing to Evolve a Painting! Note: I'm not actually sure what needs to be done at the moment; I've considered this project complete. Try evolving your own paintings and adding it to `screenshots`. You can also give me a star ðŸ¥º.
